# Vivint Software Engineer in Test Assessment

### Repository Purpose
This repository contains python scripts for the assessment prolems for Vivint Smart Home.

### Script Execution
To execute the palindrome script, simply run `python3 palindrome.py text.txt`. The `text.txt` file contains a list of words.
You can expand the list as desired to check for accuracy.

To execute the bank script, run `python3 bank.py`. You will receive prompts once executed to get the desired outputs. 
When asked if you would like to make another transaction, typing anything other than 'yes' or 'y' will terminate the program.

To execute the json conversion script, run `python3 jsonConverter.py`. It will use the `inputJson.json` to output a new json file.
You can output to any file by specifying the file path using the `-o` argument. You may specify an alternate input file using `-i`.
